## First Verse 
"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,


   As he landed his crew with care;
   
   
Supporting each man on the top of the tide


   By a finger entwined in his hair.
   
   
   "Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
   
   
   That alone should encourage the crew.
   
   
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:


   What I tell you three times is true."<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

## Second Verse
He halted in the wind, and - what was that


Far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?


He stood there bringing March against his thought,


And yet too ready to believe the most.


"Oh, that's the Paradise-in-bloom," I said;


And truly it was fair enough for flowers


had we but in us to assume in march


Such white luxuriance of May for ours.


We stood a moment so in a strange world,


Myself as one his own pretense deceives;


And then I said the truth (and we moved on).


A young beech clinging to its last year's leaves.

## Third Verse
"The sun was shining on the sea,


Shining with all his might
      
      
He did his very best to make


The billows smooth and bright
      
      
And this was odd, because it was


The middle of the night.

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
